Q1
Time complexity is O(n)
To improve the code, you can use mathematical properties to optimize the calculation. The sum of the first O(n) natural numbers can be expressed as (n(n+1))/2 So, you can directly calculate the sum without the need for nested loops
After adjustment the time complexity will be O(1)
